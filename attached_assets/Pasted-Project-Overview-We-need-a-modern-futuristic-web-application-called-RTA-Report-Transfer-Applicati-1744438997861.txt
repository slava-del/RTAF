Project Overview
We need a modern, futuristic web application called RTA (Report Transfer Application) for the Ministerul Energiei al Republicii Moldova. The primary function is to let authorized users upload, view, and manage documents (Excel — .xlsx — and Word — .docx). The design must use a clean, blue marine and white color palette, with subtle gradients or accents to convey a high‑tech, forward‑looking aesthetic.

Global Requirements

Color palette: deep marine blue (#0B3D91), sky blue (#4A90E2), white (#FFFFFF)

Typography: sans‑serif, geometric (e.g. Montserrat, Roboto)

Iconography: line‑based, minimalist

Layout: responsive grid, clear hierarchy, generous white space

Interactions: smooth transitions, hover/focus states, micro‑animations for feedback

1. Authentication

Login / Signup page

Fields: Username, Password

“Forgot password?” link

Use a split‑screen or card layout with a hero image or abstract animated background in blue gradients.

2. Company Data Page

Show basic company info: name, address, registration number, contact details

Include a consolidated “Order” table or dashboard summary:

Columns: Order ID, Date, Status, Total Documents

Quick‑action buttons: View, Download, Edit

3. Residents’ Data Page

Display resident records from both an external registry API and the internal database

Table view with sortable columns: Name, ID, Address, Registration Date

Ability to toggle between “External” and “Internal” sources

Checkboxes or multi‑select dropdown to choose specific fields or records for export

4. Type/Field Selection Page

Provide a set of filters or dropdown menus to select data types (e.g., financial, personal, administrative) or individual fields (e.g., name, ID, date of birth)

Show a preview panel of selected fields in tabular form

5. (Optional) Intermediate Validation Step

After selection, show a summary form where the user can validate or correct entries before proceeding

Include inline validation and tooltips

6. Pre‑Buy (Pre‑Payment) Order Page

A “draft order” form where users specify:

Document package (e.g., number of files, type)

Price per unit, total cost

Quantity selector, date picker for delivery

“Save Draft” and “Proceed to Payment” buttons

7. Form Submission / Sending Page

Final review of all order details

“Confirm and Send” button, with a summary sidebar showing cost breakdown

Inline checks (e.g., required fields, payment info)

8. Notifications / Subscription Updates

A bell icon in the header showing unread notifications

A dropdown or dedicated page listing: order updates, system messages, video tutorials or alerts for subscribed users

9. Received Content (Confirmation) Page

After payment/processing, list all “Received Orders” or “Received Documents”

Table with columns: Document name, Date received, Download link, Status

Option to filter by date or type

Extra UI/UX Notes

Use a sticky header with the RTA logo and main navigation (Company Data, Residents, Orders, Notifications, Profile)

Breadcrumbs on deeper pages for context

Loading skeletons for data tables

Accessibility: high contrast text, keyboard‑navigable, ARIA labels

Deliverables

High‑fidelity mockups (desktop & mobile)

Style guide (colors, typography, components)

Prototype with basic navigation and sample data
